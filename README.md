This app was created for an internal Dev Talk I held at the [Lean-Coders](https://lean-coders.at/) office.

The goal was to expose my (mostly webdev) colleagues to my favourite framework - Flutter.


### Functionality

I had lots of ideas for a fitting showcase app in mind. In the end, I went the nostalgic route and rewrote my [very first Flutter project](https://github.com/S-ecki/Wordpair_Generator). 
The project follows the simple idea from [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) Google Codelab: It exposes a list of randomly generated wordpairs and provides the possibility to save certain ones.



### Technologies

With the aim of sharing as much interesting tech, I ruthlessly overengineered the app using
- [Very Good CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_cli)
- [Auto Router](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)
- [BLoC State Management](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)
- [Flutter Localizations](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
- [Build Flavours](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b)
- [Very Good Analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis)
- [Layered Architecture](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture)
